    title: "What is D-Chip?",
    description: `D-Chip is an independent association that was founded in the fall of 1995. 
            Our purpose is to promote the well-being and safety of women and non-binary individuals 
            in the D-guild of TLTH at Lund University's Faculty of Engineering (LTH), 
            as well as to strengthen their engagement.

            In the fall we organize a welcoming lunch the day before the semester starts and a mentorship program for all new students,
             as well as a variety of other activities and events throughout the remainder of the year.

            As a "nolla", you are called a microchip. Once you are elevated to a first-year student, you can call yourself D-Chip.  
            Alumni are also referred to as Super Hacker Babes, a tradition that has been in place since the association
             was founded 30 years ago. A D-Chip, in addition to having a pink (Computer Engineering) or 
             purple (Information and Communication Technology) tassel, also has a pink ribbon.`,
