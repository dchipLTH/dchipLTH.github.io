    welcomingLunch: "Welcoming Lunch",
    welcomingLunchInfo: `The day before the start of the semester, D-Chip traditionally organizes a welcome lunch on campus, where you, as a newly admitted woman or non-binary person to Computer Engineering or Information & Communication Technology, are welcome. The lunch is a perfect opportunity to meet other newly admitted students as well as older students. More information about the welcome lunch will be released sometime in early August.`,
    mentorship: "Mentorship Program",
    mentorshipInfo: `During the fall semester, D-Chip organizes a mentorship program where you, as a new student, have the opportunity to connect with older female and non-binary students studying the same as you. The program is intended to provide support for women and non-binary individuals in the D-guild at the start of their studies and aims to create a safe and welcoming environment.\n
    The mentorship program is a great opportunity to get to know more women and non-binary individuals in the D-guild. In addition to being paired with a mentor, events and activities will also be organized where all participants in the program—both mentees and mentors—can gather and get to know each other.\n
    Together with your mentor, you'll have the chance to talk about everything from student life and studies to life in Lund in general. The mentors are bound by confidentiality, meaning you can feel safe knowing that anything shared stays between you and your mentor.\n
    Information on how to sign up for the mentorship program will be released sometime during the fall.`
