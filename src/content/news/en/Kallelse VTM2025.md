Hello dear members,

VTM is quickly approaching for D-Chip, and we warmly welcome all members to the association meeting, where we will, among other things, elect a new Vice Chairperson, Event Manager, and Business Relations Manager to the board. Please feel free to help us nominate candidates for these positions.

The meeting will be held on April 14th in E:C, starting at 17:15. Food registration and other meeting documents will be sent out shortly.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to d-chipordforande@dsek.se.

Hope to see you there!
