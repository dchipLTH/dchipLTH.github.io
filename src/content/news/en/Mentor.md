Hi!!

Do you want to help D-chip with welcoming new members next semester?

D-chip is now looking for mentor for our mentorship program next semester. The purpose of the program is to make more women and non-binaries stay at D and C, and give some safety and good connections for the new students. As a mentor, this means that you will be paired with 1-2 microchip (mentees) at the beginning of the semester. You will then meet with your mentee a few times throughout the semester, whenever you want.

There is not going to be that many events during the autumn semester, which means combining being a mentor with other responsibilities will work fine.

D-chip is going to a arrange an event at the end of the semester for everyone that took part in the mentorship program.
