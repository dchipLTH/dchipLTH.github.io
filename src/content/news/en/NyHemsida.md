**Welcome to D-Chip's new website!**

We are incredibly happy and proud to present our brand-new website! This project started about a year ago, and now we can finally share it with you.

We want to give a special shoutout to Josefin Wetterstrand, who has been the driving force behind the development and design of the website. Without her, this wouldn’t have even happened – and it turned out far better than we could have ever hoped for! A huge thanks also to Daniel Adu-Gyan, who has been super helpful throughout the entire process.

If you come across anything that seems off or isn’t working properly, please let us know – we truly appreciate all feedback.

We hope you like the site as much as we do!

**On behalf of the board,**\
Hanna Arendt\
Vice President 24/25
