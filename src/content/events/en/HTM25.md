On 24 November at 17:00, it’s time for D-Chip’s Autumn Term Meeting (HTM)!

The term meetings are D-Chip’s highest decision-making body, and we have many important decisions to make. Among other things, we’ll elect a new President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Head of Communications. Auditors will also be elected.

During the meeting we’ll provide some fika for our members, and after the meeting we’ll have a shared dinner in iDét! (the meeting usually takes between 1-2 hours) We promise good food and great company—and of course it’s free!

However, we need to know how many are coming so we have enough food for everyone. Please fill out this form if you’ll be attending. If you’ve filled out the form and then can’t make it, please contact us at d-chipordforande@dsek.se.

Hope to see you there!

Best regards,
The HT25 Board
